# lvtcircles

This project is a simple circle leader tracker built with React and Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS with daisyUI for styling and connects to Supabase for data storage.
The legacy HTML demo has been removed in favour of a single React application located in the `app` directory.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix app
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --prefix app
   ```

The application is served at `http://localhost:5173` by default. If you build for
production with `npm run build --prefix app`, open `app/dist/index.html` in a
browser to see the styled UI.
